My name is Jason Alexander Fenton Hall and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, as well as a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.  I am interested in networks, firm dynamics, game theory in macroeconomics, and the economics of scientific progress.
