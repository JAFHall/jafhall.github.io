My name is Jason Alexander Fenton Hall and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, as well as a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, working with Marco Bassetto.  I am interested in game theory in macroeconomics, the economics of science and innovation, and the effectiveness and design of R&D policy.  You can contact me at hall2160 at umn dot edu.
